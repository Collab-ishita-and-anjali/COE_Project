# COE_Project 
An open source cross platform application for remote learning.
## Our App Execution stack (For Now)
### app.js -> stackNavigatior.js -> LoginScreen.js -> DepartmentScreen.js
## General Instructions
1. If you are adding a new screen , put your screen.js file in /screen directory and update the stackNavigatior.js file.

3. For adding multimedia resources like images ,icons,fonts ,place it in the asset diretory.
4. Try not make any changes to app.js.(For Now)
5. Always make a pull request ,even if it's a small feature, to avoid merge conflict
6. **Always Update your local repository before adding any new code by following Section 3**
## Required Software :
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. A Code Editor e.g [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Steps to contribute in this Project:
### Section 1 - Configure your git-scm
1. Open CMD/Terminal 
2. Windows user set :`git config --global core.autocrlf true`
3. Linux user set :`git config --global core.autocrlf input`
### Section 2 - Contributing to the project
1. Fork this repository as your own repo.
2. Clone your fork:
    `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/COE_Project.git`
3. **Add remote from original repository in your forked repository :** 
    * Go to COE_PROJECT folder and the commands given below
    * `git remote add upstream https://github.com/DCSA-Devs/COE_Project.git`
4. Run `npm install` to install all dependency.
5. **Do the neccessary changes add components/features etc**
6. **Run  `npm start` to check the applicatin has no errors and is running fine.**
7. If the application is running fine & your changes are working then run `git add .` command
8. commit the changes using  `git commit -m"Your message"`
9. Push the changes to your forked repo using `git push` commmand
10. Now compare and create a pull request using **github.com ,Ensure there is no merge conflict**
### Section 3 Upating the local repository with the main repository
1. `git fetch`
2. `git fetch upstream` :It will show changes others team member has done
3. `git merge upstream/master` :It will merge changes,your work will not be deleted but merge conflict may arise
4. Optional : `git pull upstream master` :Do this if you not able to solve merge-conflict **It will delete the changes you previously made,therefore it is always recomended to follow these steps before adding any new feature**
5. **Now you can repeat the Section 2,  point 4 to point 8 to contribute further**
## Running the program
1. After cloning the repository goto project root & run command `npm install` 
2. This will download all the required npm modules (make sure you are connected to internet)
3. Finally run `node app.js` or `npm start` to run the application

During the development period the website will be deployed/updated at **https://coeproject.herokuapp.com/**
